Description of example:
 -120 seconds
 -100 nodes
 -1400m x 1400m area
 -3 instances per destination
 -21 data sources per destination
 -1 anycast destination
 -Random way point mobility (pause time = 10s, speed = (1,20)s uniform)

HOW TO RUN IT:
 -open a terminal and paste the following  command
   cd ~/ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/idmidr_example
 -open idmidr.tcl file and set rp to IDMIDR or AODV (i.e., set val(rp) IDMIDR or set val(rp) AODV)
 -open a terminal and paste the following  command
   ns idmidr.tcl

Output trace is outpout.tr. After analizing it:
  -PDR (received packets/sent packets) -> IDMIDR = 0.93819, Anycast AODV = 0.581238
  -Control Overhead (Transmitted bytes by routing protocol) -> IDMIDR = 6798350, Anycast AODV = 19121558
  -Total Overhead (Total transmitted bytes) -> IDMIDR = 22712978, Anycast AODV = 35165742

IMPORTANT NOTICE
  -Anycast addresses must be greater than the total number of nodes.
    For example: if there are 100 nodes in the simulation, anycast
    addresses must be at least 101.
  -For AODV, anycast addresses must be greater than or equal to ANYCAST_ADRESS at ~/ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35/aodv/aodv.h
    For example: anycast adresses greater than 100, ANYCAST_ADRESS must be 101, 
    i.e., #define ANYCAST_ADDRESS 101
